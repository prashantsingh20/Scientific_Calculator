Advanced operations can be viewed by clicking << and closed by clicking >>
Opening operators are not recognized, with the exception of functions
To swap sign (go from positive to negative or vice versa) enter a number and then press the +/- key
Decimals can only be pressed once per number, but can be used as the opening key press for a number
Pressing an operator key after an operator was just input will update the operator to the most recently pressed operator key
Pressing a function key after another function key will nest the most recent function inside of the previous function. The calculation will bubble from in to out.
Terminal operators will cause all calculations before the operator to be repeated after the operator as well and the total of all calculations will be returned.

History has two modes. These modes can be toggled by clicking in the top right of the history box on either calc or ans
When in calc mode the history section will contain calculation strings that you have previously executed. Double clicking one will place it in the display and allow you to add to or change the calculation string
When in ans mode the history section will contain previous solutioins. If the last item in the display is an operator, double clicking on a history solution will add it after the operator. If the last item in the display is a number, double clicking on a history solution will replace the display number with the history solution number
Using the ans history recall allows for a form of parenthetical usage. For example: calculate PI / 2 and get the result. Then press sin: and double click on the result of PI / 2 in the history answers section. Pressing equals will give you a return value of 1 (the correct answer). While inputing sin: PI / 2 will execute the function before the division, which is not generally the intended calculation. Good usage of the history will allow for most usage
History will store the last seven calculations with the most recent at the top
